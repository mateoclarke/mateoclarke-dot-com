The Dynamo Scrumboard is an internal app I built for our team at Charity Dynamics. I used Ember.js (Ember-CLI) along with Firebase as a datastore to create a simple tool that helps our team capture scrum information to aid our agile methodology. The Dynamo Scrumboard lives on a display visibile to all our team in the office. This helps our project managers and web dev managers know who has availability to jump in on new projects. This was my first Ember app.
