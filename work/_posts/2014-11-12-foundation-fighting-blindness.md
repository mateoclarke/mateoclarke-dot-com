The Foundation Fighting Blindness leads national fundraising efforts for research that will provide preventions, treatments and cures for people affected by retinal diseases. Charity Dynamics has been working with them for many years and this site redesign was my first experience building a custom Drupal site. I utlized Gulp & Sass to speed up the theme development.
