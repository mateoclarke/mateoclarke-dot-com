The Foundation Fighting Blindness Summer Challenge was a people-powered summer campaign to raise critical funds to support sight-saving research and tell the world about the great progress. It was built as a Convio Luminate Online Microsite that encouraged consituents to make a pledge, send a message to Congress, donate and create their own fundraising campaign to raise awareness for FFB.
