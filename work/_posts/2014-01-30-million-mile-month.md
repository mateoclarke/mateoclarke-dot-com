Million Mile Month was my final project as a Makersquare student. It is a Ruby on Rails app that uses the MapMyFitness API to allow user to log their miles towards the community goal of 1 million miles each April. This was a Coding for a Cause project where Makersquare students partner with local nonprofits to build an app that meets an important business need for a real client.
