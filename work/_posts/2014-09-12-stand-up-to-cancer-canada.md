Stand Up 2 Cancer Canada is a program of the Entertainment Industry Foundation that leverages their partnerships with actors and entertainers to raise funds and awareness for cancer research. The cornerstone of this program is a national telecast hosted by Gwyneth Paltrow and Katie Couric in Los Angeles. In 2014, SU2C also broadcasted from Canada on many of the major Canadian networks. This site was built using ExpressionEngine CMS and was the first experience that anyone at Charity Dynamics had with the platform.
