Casar for Council is a political campaign site for a local community organizer and friend I greatly respect, Greg Casar. This was my first Jekyll site and I utilized Grunt in my workflow. I was also able to link the volunteer form on the landing page to a Google Spreadsheet to make it as easy as possible for the campaign team to keep record of their consituents in a format that was simple for them. This was achieved with Google Scripts. In addition to the Jekyll site, I created a Ghost blog that was easier for other members of the campaign team to moderate themsleves.
