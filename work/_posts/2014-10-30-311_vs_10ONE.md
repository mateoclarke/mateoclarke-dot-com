The 311 Vs 10ONE Data Vizualization was a project that was born at the ATX Hackathon for Change in May 2014. The basic idea is that citizens and policymakers could benefit from vizualizing 311 data by districts to compare and constrast the trends and issues that each district faces. This app relies on the Leaflet.js mapping library and a bunch of jQuery that submits calls and moves around data provided by the Socrata API, the company that manages the City of Austin's Data Portal.
