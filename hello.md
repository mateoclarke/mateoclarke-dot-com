I am a **Front End Engineer** at [AcademicWorks](https://www.academicworks.com/), where I work to enhance the user experience of scholarship software that matches students with opportunities so they can afford their education.

I am also the **Director of Civic Hacking** at [OpenAustin](http://www.open-austin.org), a [Code For America](http://www.codeforamerica.com) Brigade that has two main goals: 

* Push the [Open Governance movement](http://opengovernmentinitiative.org/) at the City of Austin and Travis County.
* [Build civic apps](http://www.open-austin.org/hack-team/projects) with Open Data.

*[See my work](/work)*

Beyond pushing pixels and shipping code, I have a few hobbies and interests:

* I play music, mostly on my fiddle. 
* Me and my wife, Laura, grow food in our backyard and we try to keep our three cats happy. 
* I read books about economics, foreign policy, technology, and adventure. 
* I speak Spanish & Portuguese with varying degrees of confidence. 
* I've played, watched, and breathed soccer since I could speak. _Amo o jogo bonito_.
* I cheer for my San Antonio Spurs.
* I love breakfast tacos as much as life itself.
